    <h1>Barcelona</h1>
    <p>Our trip began in Barcelona, a major port and popular tourist destination on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.
        Founded by the Romans, today Barcelona is the cultural hub of Catalonia, an autonomous region within Spain
        defined by its distinctive culture and strong independence movement.</p>

    <p>The city is also known for its stunning architecture. Perhaps the most famous example of this is Sagrada Familia,
        an immense cathedral in the "Eixample" neighborhood of the city. Designed by renowned Catalan architect Antoni
        Gaudi, the cathedral is as yet unfinished. Its unique design and stunning interior make it perhaps the most
        popular tourist site in the city. Small wonder, then, that Sagrada Familia has been declared a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site.</p>

    <p>Cathedrals aside, there are many other less prominent points of interest in Barcelona. Roman ruins abound, as do
        quiet courtyards, stately medieval buildings, and striking hilltop vistas.</p>
