    <h1>Madrid</h1>
    <p>From Barcelona, we traveled via train to Madrid, the capital of Spain. Home to over 3 million residents, Madrid's
        stately avenues, grand parks, and world-renowned museums give it a cosmopolitan feel.</p>
    <p>While in Madrid, one must-see destination is the Plaza Mayor. Built in the late 16th century during the reign of
        Philip III, the Plaza Mayor is a vibrant hub within the old city center, home to upscale restaurants and shops.
