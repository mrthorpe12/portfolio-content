    <h1>Sevilla and Andalucia</h1>
    <p>A day's train ride from Madrid is Andalucia, the southernmost region of Spain. Conquered by Moorish kings in the
        8th century A.D., the region has a unique flair that combines Spanish Catholic culture with Islamic
        architecture. Sevilla, the capital of Andalucia, offers picturesque alleys, buildings, and squares. Peacocks
        roam in the city's gardens and parks, while at the heart of the old city is the Real Alcazar, former home of the
        Moorish rulers and today a prominent landmark.</p>

    <p>From Sevilla, one can take a day trip to the fortress town of Granada, home to what is perhaps the region's most
        famous attraction - La Alhambra. Begun in 1238 by Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, then the ruler of Granada, the
        fortress was built in stages until it was seized during the Christian conquest of
        Andalucia, a period known as the Reconquista. Following the Reconquista, the Alhambra became home to the royal
        court of Spain. It was here that Christopher Columbus received the endorsement of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and
        Isabella when
        preparing his expedition to the East. Today the site is world-renowned, as is the town of Grenada.</p>

    <p>From Grenada, it is possible to visit the more rural parts of Andalucia, including the region's famous "hill
        towns". Built by the Spanish conquistadors during the Reconquista, today these fortified outposts are known for
        their stunning whitewashed buildings and streets. Stop for a glass of sangria and enjoy the sweeping vistas
        which many of these towns command.</p>
