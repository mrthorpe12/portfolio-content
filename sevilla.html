        <h1>Sevilla and Andalucia</h1>
        <p>A day's train ride from Madrid is Andalucia, the southernmost region of Spain. Conquered by Moorish kings
            from
            North Africa in the
            8th century A.D., the region has a unique flair that combines Spanish Catholic culture with Islamic
            architecture. Sevilla, the capital of Andalucia, offers picturesque alleys, buildings, and squares. Peacocks
            roam in the city's gardens and parks, while at the heart of the old city is the Real Alcazar, former home of
            the
            Moorish rulers and today a prominent landmark that draws toursits from across the globe.[1]</p>

        <p>From Sevilla, one can take a day trip to the fortress town of Granada, home to what is perhaps the region's
            most
            famous attraction - La Alhambra. Begun in 1238 by Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, then the ruler of Granada, the
            fortress-palace was built in stages until it was seized during the Christian invasion of
            Andalucia, a period known as the Reconquista. Following the Reconquista, the Alhambra became home to the
            royal
            court of Spain. It was here that Christopher Columbus received the endorsement of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand
            and
            Isabella when
            planning his expedition to Asia. Today the site is world-renowned, as is the town of Grenada.[2]</p>

        <p>From Grenada, it is possible to visit the more rural parts of Andalucia, including the region's famous "hill
            towns". Built to defend Catholic settlements in Andalucia during the Reconquista, today these fortified
            outposts
            are known for
            their stunning whitewashed buildings and cobbled streets. Stop for a glass of sangria and enjoy the sweeping
            vistas
            which many of these towns command.[3]</p>
